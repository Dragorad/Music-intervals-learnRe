<strong>--- Learning app for music intervals by tests ---</strong> <br /><br />
<strong>--- Includes interactive SVG keyboard ---</strong> <br /><br />
Set a response time between 2 and 20 seconds, a number of tasks of at least 2, and select at least one music interval on which to ask questions.
        Each type of interval included in the test gives 20 points for a correct answer.
        Every second allowed to respond reduces the result for true answer with1 point.
        Example: 
          If the test involves only a few seconds for each answer, you will get 20 points minus the number of seconds to answer. 
          If you give yourself 15 seconds for thinking, you will have 5 points for each correct answer.',
          If the test includes small seconds, small and large thirds for each answer you will get 60 points minus the number of seconds.',
          If the seconds are 5 for the answer you will get 55 t. Every wrong answer takes as many points as you can for a faithful answer.

This pas you can for a faithful answer.
